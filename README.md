# Wireshark ICMP Packet Capture

This repository contains a Wireshark capture file (`ping.pcapng`) that includes four ICMP requests and four ICMP responses, generated by pinging `google.com` from a terminal in Kali Linux.

## Steps Followed

1. **Open Wireshark**:
   - Launch Wireshark in Kali Linux.
   - Select the `eth0` interface to capture packets.

2. **Start Packet Capture**:
   - Begin capturing packets on the `eth0` interface.

3. **Ping Google**:
   - Open a terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     ping -c 4 google.com
     ```
   - This command sends four ICMP echo requests to `google.com` and receives four replies.

4. **Filter ICMP Packets**:
   - In Wireshark, apply the following filter to display only ICMP packets:
     ```
     icmp
     ```
   - Verify that there are exactly four ICMP requests and four ICMP replies.

5. **Save Capture**:
   - Stop the capture once the ping command completes.
   - Save the capture as `ping.pcapng`.

6. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Place the `ping.pcapng` file in the `task-6` directory of your GitHub repository.
